          Hi, I'm Tatianna Dugue, a freshman at Columbia University.
          This is a series of texts, thoughts, prose and poetry I have created over the years.
          Midnight Musings is a collection of poems and lines that have followed me all the way to sleep.
          They have been the poems I have woken up to, the lines that are painted to back of my eyelids as I fall asleep,
          the thoughts that shape my dreams.
        </b>
      </p>

      <div class="text-container" id= "unwrittenpoem">
        <p>
         <u>Unwritten</u>
       </p>
        <p>
          All the unspoken thoughts we write
        </p>
        <p>Erased in a frenzy by a cursor</p>
        <p>So close to being revealed</p>
          <p>But taken away in a second</p>
          <p>How many things did u have to say to me</p>
          <p>that were missed in an instance?</p>
        <p>How many times did you stop</p>
        <p>because I changed the tone?</p>
          <p>Will you ever tell me those thoughts later on</p>
            <p>when the time is right?</p>
          <p>Or will that empty space be it's only memory?</p>
        </p>

          <u>High School Smile</u>
        </p>
        <p> She said you looked happy today </p>
<p> And I replied it must be because of your new phone </p>
<p> But a tiny part of me couldn’t help but </p>
<p> wonder if you were happy because of me </p>
<p> Although there are a million little things </p>
<p> that could’ve made you smile </p>
<p> I hope that in that moment when you looked at her face, you thought of me and <p/>
<p> couldn’t help it but smile </p>
<p> That your day became slightly less dreary because you had memories of me. </p>
<p></p>
<p> When I look into the hallways and walk up </p>
<p> the stairs, I see a flash of remembrance and think of you </p>
<p> I can’t help but let my lips rise up from my </p>
<p> chin and look down to hide my silly grin </p>
<p> Those moments of pure joy in those dark hallways </p>
<p> are the best fleeting things I will ever have. </p>
