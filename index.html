          <p>
            Inspired by the growing community fridge movement, we worked with
            fridge organizers in New York City to provide a more consolidated
            system of resource sharing across the fridge network while aligning
            with their core values.

          <h2>The Problem Space</h2>

          <p>
            Community fridges are mutual aid projects in which community members
            stock and maintain publicly accessible fridges to provide food to
            whoever needs it. The first fridge in NYC was set up in February of
            2020 and since then the movement has grown to over 70 fridges. Since
            this is a new and growing movement, organizers are constantly in the
            process of figuring out what works and what does not. Due to the
            autonomous and decentralized structure of community fridge networks,
            each fridge has its own set of practices and resources. While
            organizers often collaborate and learn from one another, there is no
            openly accessible platform for resource sharing across all fridges
            in a given area.

          <h2>Our Solution</h2>

          <p>
            Our solution to this problem is to develop a web app for resource
            sharing amongst community organizers. The platform will allow
            organizers to find and share resources with one another, such as
            templates for business outreach and guides on how to address various
            obstacles.

          <h2>Background Research</h2>

          <p>
            Our research began with food insecurity, when a household has
            limited or uncertain access to food. We focused our background
            research on news articles and reports from NYC based organizations,
            all of which were citing similar data that revealed food insecurity
            has dramatically increased due to the pandemic. During the pandemic
            in NYC, there has also been an amazing increase in mutual aid, or
            community members helping and supporting one another without stigma
            associated with charity. A mutual aid project to combat food
            insecurity that grew in popularity during the pandemic are community
            fridges, refrigerators located in a public space that provide fresh
            free food to community members. The fridge is restocked by community
            members (also known as community fridge organizers) and is open to
            everyone, functioning in a policy of “Take what you need, leave what
            you can.”
          </p>

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After identifying community fridges in NYC as an area of interest,
            we looked at articles to learn the details of how community fridges
            operate and if technology could support them. Many of the articles
            we found were features of community fridge organizers posted this
            summer when the movement first began receiving attention from
            websites like the New York Times.

          <h2>Engagement</h2>

          <p>
            Since community fridges are a relatively new movement, there is a
            sparse amount of information available about them online and once we
            had gone through it all, we turned to Instagram to get in contact
            with fridge organizers. Instagram is the primary platform where
            community fridge organizers will post information and updates about
            their respective fridges. We began by documenting all the community
            fridge instagram accounts we came across and DM’ing them to request
            interviews to learn more about their work.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Through interviews, we quickly learned that community fridges are
            autonomous and decentralized, so each fridge operates and organizes
            itself differently. Despite differences in how fridges operate,
            there are common tasks that each fridge undertakes in order to
            provide food to community members and we designed a diagram of the
            Community Fridge Process to visualize these core commonalities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition, we created four Personas and User Journey Maps in order
            to capture high and low points organizers expressed in interviews.

            The direction our project took was limited to who we were able to

            conducted focused on community fridge organizers and their
            experience with maintaining a community fridge. We were not able to
            identify and interview other stakeholders of a community fridge,
            such as food insecure populations and/or people who utilize
            community fridges. While organizers are easily contactable online
            via instagram, there is no way to know who is using fridges. Since
            that is a perspective we were missing, it heavily influenced the
            direction we continued in.

              Third How Might We: How might we help community fridges form more consistent, long-term relationships with its food sources?"
          />
          <p>
            After interviewing ten community fridge organizers and creating four
            user journey maps, we came up with a list of 14 themes that captured
            common pain points in the community fridge process. In order to
            narrow these themes to the most relevant few, we designed an
            affinity map that grouped insightful quotes from all ten interviews
            based on the theme they expressed. With the help of the affinity
            map, we were able to identify eight themes that had been brought up
            the most in interviews and from there we ideated on one way we could
            potentially target or address this theme. We also looked at previous
            solutions to these themes and identified the pros and cons of each.
            Once we had a more comprehensive picture of the needs and obstacles
            of community organizers, as well as potential solutions, we
            developed three How Might We statements that captured overarching
            themes we felt we could meaningfully address this semester. For each
            How Might We, we brainstormed 30 ideas and used a mindmap to
            visualize where they branch off from one another. We then narrowed
            them down to five coherent and varied ideas per How Might We and
            identified the risks of each.

          <p>Are there any unintended consequences in our how might we’s?</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When deciding which themes and directions to pursue, we were
            critical of potential negative impacts. For example, if we focused
            on increasing outreach and community awareness of fridges, could the
            over-promotion lead to too many community members depending on or
            taking food from the fridge, to the point where it might be unable
            to sustain itself? Additionally, we were hesitant to go in a
            direction that could lead to the over-standardization and
            organization of fridges because if there is too much organization,
            fridges may need to register government entities or non-profits,
            which can be difficult or lead to taxation struggles.

          <h2>Research impact</h2>

          <p>
            Based on the main pain points expressed to us by community fridge
            organizers, we narrowed down our potential product to four ideas: a
            scheduling app, a physical sensor to track fridge emptiness, a
            collaboration with an existing application, and a living resource
            document. We created low-fidelity wireframes for each of these
            designs. The scheduling app would have created a single location for
            volunteers and organizers to coordinate restocking shifts with one
            another; the sensors would have been physically attached to each
            fridge to track how long the fridge was opened for, in order to
            judge emptiness intervals; the collaboration with an existing
            application would have focused on connecting local businesses with
            community fridges; and the living resource document would allow
            community fridges to share various resources, templates, and
            information with one another to help the community fridge network
            flourish.
            <br />
            Eventually, we settled on moving forward with the resource document,
            based on subsequent user tests in which we asked our target users
            about how effective and how helpful they anticipated each design
            being for them. While our interviewees were split on the resource
            document versus an app, we realized that a place for community
            fridges to share resources with one another upheld the core tenets
            of the mutual aid structure, despite being somewhat less flashy than
            an app. It had also become clear that organizers would be hesitant
            to download another app, since the organization process is already
            spread out across several platforms. Once we settled on a single
            design, we decided based on user interviews that email templates,
            resource guides, and a community forum would be the most useful
            sections to include.

            using a more minimalist, “cleaner” design, but decided that the
            colors and fun icons were more appealing based on initial user
            tests. In terms of the layout, we looked to familiar websites that
            served similar purposes to our own for inspiration, such as
            Dribbble, Ladder, and others.

            in our Figma, and allows users to ask questions to the community,

          <h2>PIT Design Process Reflection</h2>
          <p class="sub-title">
            Since different community organizers had different needs, it was
            difficult to make decisions that wouldn’t meet every organizer’s
            needs. We ultimately decided to choose a solution that would be most
            inclusive and accessible for our users.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we went through the design process, different community
            organizers were drawn to different solutions. We realized that our
            prototype was not going to be able to accommodate everyone’s needs
            equally or solve every need that we found. Instead, we had to decide
            which subset of the user group we wanted to have an impact on in
            order to focus our solution on their needs. Even though some
            organizers preferred other solutions, almost all expressed worry
            about the ‘buy-in’ of downloading another app. As such, we decided
            to focus on the living resource guide over the scheduling app, as
            this seemed to be the most open and inclusive solution. Furthermore,
            we wanted to consistently keep in mind what technology our users
            would use, since public interest technology should first and
            foremost be accessible to our users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="sub-title">
            Our ultimate goal of public interest technology was promoting social
            good by supporting community fridges, so we wanted to always make
            sure our interests were aligned with their needs. In particular, we
            consistently considered how to balance the organizers’ desires for a
            decentralized system and creating a more standardized system for
            resource sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking a user-centered approach to our design allowed for us to
            engage with the target audience early on and throughout the process.
            This led us to have a more impactful design process and a better
            understanding of the pain points within the community fridge
            networks. There were also unique considerations our organizers
            brought up in our interviews with them that we had not previously
            considered. For example, our design needed to align with the
            mutual-aid framework of community fridges and work within their
            decentralized system. Rather than designing based on our limited
            knowledge, user centered design allowed us to ensure our final
            product was aligned with our communities goals.

            While it was challenging at times, we learned the value in sitting
            with our problem space rather than jumping to solutions by following
            the design process.double diamond.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Double diamond design process created a structure that allowed
            us to anticipate what was coming next, yet at some points we found
            it challenging to not move ahead. When the team was trying to
            conduct interviews to identify problems, we were also thinking ahead
            and taking suggestions for solutions when we should have remained
            focused on the “define” stage, rather than ideation. In order to
            remain within the structure, we had to be intentional to not jump
            ahead before we fully explored and defined the problem.

            A question that came up throughout the process and we advise
            technologists in public interest technology to consider is around
            commitment and longevity of involvement with the product and the
            community.
